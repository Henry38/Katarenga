TODOs
- thread server sends the configuration of the board to the graphics thread (sends a string containing the 64 types of cells of the board).
- the graphics thread is the main thread. In the standalone version of Katarenga it spawns a child thread which will hold the server. In the "network" version it will spawn a child thread that will communicate with the server and forward the events to the graphics thread (maybe there is a solution where the graphics thread listens directly to a socket to communicate with the server).
- put the resources of the chess pieces + board tilings in a resources directory of Katarenga (and not GLTK)


TODO Network :
- besoin de gérer si problème réseau, connexion au socket perdu -> besoin de terminer le thread GL.
- besoin de gérer les déconnexion des clients.
